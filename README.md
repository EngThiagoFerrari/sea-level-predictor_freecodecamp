### Message from Thiago Ferrari  
This is my solution for freeCodeCamp.org's Sea Level Predictor - Data Analysis with Python


This boilerplate brings all the necessary files for running and testing the program.
The file I edited was the "sea_level_predictor.py" where I wrote the python program following the instructions stated on freeCodeCamp.org link mentioned above.  

The file main.py imports the "sea_level_predictor.py" to be excecuted. It also starts the test_module.py - where I could check whether or not I met all of the project's requirements.

Through the analysis of the data set "epa-sea-level.csv" with Pandas and Scipy. Then I plotted the chart: "sea_level_plot.png".
